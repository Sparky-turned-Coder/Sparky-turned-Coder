- 👋 Hi, I’m Chris.
- 👀 I’m interested in electricity and programming. 
- 🌱 I’m currently making games in Scratch, and meandering aimlessly around in C, the Lord's language.
- 📫 How to reach me? chrisjones5452@outlook.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been an electrician for over 10 years, and my hobbies are reading, programming, and gamedev.
